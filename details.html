                <p class="text-small">The most important item on any football equipment list is a helmet, which protects the head from injury during games and practice. Helmets are designed to protect the head from impact caused by flying balls as well as blunt force from the ground and other players.                </p>

                <p class="text-small">Protecting the groin is crucial in a game of football, which can be hazardous to any region that incurs severe impact. With a cup worn for protection at all times on the field, there's less risk of injury to this sensitive area.</p>

                <p class="text-small">To protect the mouth and teeth during a game, a mouth guard is essential for the field. One hit to the jaw or lips can knock out a tooth, while the jaw could easily get broken during a rough field encounter if not protected by a mouth piece that fits.</p>

                <p class="text-small">Arms and legs are placed through various trials on the field that joints aren't naturally built to endure. To ensure the knees and elbows aren't subject to undue force that could break the bones or strain the cartilage, pads along these joints are among the more essential football accessories. </p>

                <p class="text-small">Strong shoulders are crucial in just about any type of sport, especially football. However, no player's shoulders are strong enough to withstand the force of tackles unscathed. With shoulder pads to protect this crucial area of the body, a player is less likely to miss games due to torn ligaments or muscle strain in this area.</p>

                <p class="text-small">As one of the world's most hands-on sports, it's important that football players keep their hands free of injury. Certain players are more susceptible to hand injury than others, including receivers and linemen. Skill players often wear gloves to help catch and hold onto the ball, where as lineman usually wear gloves to protect from bruising and scratching.</p>

                <p class="text-small">For linebackers and defensive linemen, neck rolls help protect the neck and shoulders when things get rough. Given all the rough and tumble of football, the neck guard can make all the difference between comfort and soreness between games.</p>
